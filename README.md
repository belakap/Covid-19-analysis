Statistical Analysis of COVID-19 Case and Mortality Trends in Relation to Vaccination Status and Community Transmission Rates.

Abstract

This study explores how COVID-19 infection and mortality rates by age groups relate to vaccination statuses, and levels of community transmission. Two datasets were merged: one tracing historical weekly transmission rates at the county level, and another measuring COVID-19 cases and deaths by age and vaccination status. Regression models, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing are used to find important patterns. The results are displayed using data visualizations such as bar charts, heat maps, and graphs. This analysis provides evidence for optimizing vaccination distribution and tailoring intervention strategies in eventual COVID-19 or other infectious disease outbreaks.

Goals

Primary goal:  Analyze the factors influencing COVID-19 cases and death rates across age groups by examining the vaccination statuses, and the community transmission levels. 

Objectives

Analyze the Impact of Vaccination Status on Infection and Mortality Rates
Assess the Influence of Community Transmission Levels
Identify Geographic disparities
Develop Data-Driven Public Health Recommendations
Tools and technology: pandas, SQLite, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, Data Dictionary
